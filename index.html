            <p class="intro">
                I’m Natasha Chaturvedi, a passionate communications professional with
                over 5 years of experience in internal communications, brand journalism,
                and campaign strategy. My journey is rooted in crafting stories that drive
                connection and engagement. Whether it's leading impactful campaigns, mentoring
                communities, or championing causes, my aim is to inspire and create lasting impact.

    <!-- ABOUT ME -->
    <section class="about-section" id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve always believed that stories have the power to transform. Throughout my career,
            I’ve spearheaded campaigns reaching over 100,000 employees, improved engagement
            through compelling narratives, and fostered meaningful relationships across diverse industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond metrics, I value the human connection—the ability to connect, inspire, and drive change.
            My work with organizations like HCLTech and IndusInd Bank, as well as my fellowship at Teach for India,
            reflects my commitment to using communication as a force for good.

                <p class="key-takeaway">
                    <strong>Unique Insight:</strong> AI empowers teams to focus on strategy rather than routine tasks
                    by automating workflows, but maintaining the “human touch” remains a challenge.

                <p class="key-takeaway">
                    <strong>Unique Insight:</strong> Transparency, such as labeling AI-generated content,
                    can enhance trust, while the lack of clear disclosures risks eroding audience confidence.
